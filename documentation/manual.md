## Getting started 

### How to install

Start by getting the source code. Use one of the following ways to clone the repository from the command line. Alternatively, you may download the source code as a [zip package](https://github.com/rikurauhala/rikurauhala.github.io/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

```bash
# Get the source code via the command line
# Choose the way you are most familiar with
 
# Clone with SSH
$ git clone git@github.com:rikurauhala/rikurauhala.github.io.git

# Clone with HTTPS
$ git clone https://github.com/rikurauhala/rikurauhala.github.io.git

# Clone with GitHub CLI
$Â gh repo clone rikurauhala/rikurauhala.github.io
```

Next, make sure you are in the correct folder and install dependencies. The application will not work without installing dependencies first!

```bash
# Change directory
$ cd rikurauhala.github.io

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```
